Language (LCEL)On this pageLangChain Expression Language (LCEL)\\nPrerequisites\\nRunnable Interface\\n\\nThe LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) takes a declarative approach to building new Runnables from existing Runnables.\\nThis means that you describe what should happen, rather than how it should happen, allowing LangChain to optimize the run-time execution of the chains.\\nWe often refer to a Runnable created using LCEL as a \"chain\". It\\'s important to remember that a \"chain\" is Runnable and it implements the full Runnable Interface.\\nnote\\nThe LCEL cheatsheet shows common patterns that involve the Runnable interface and LCEL expressions.\\nPlease see the following list of how-to guides that cover common tasks with LCEL.\\nA list of built-in Runnables can be found in the LangChain Core API Reference. Many of these Runnables are useful when composing custom \"chains\" in LangChain using LCEL.\\n\\nBenefits of LCEL\\u200b\\nLangChain optimizes the run-time execution of chains built with LCEL in a number of ways:\\n\\nOptimized parallel execution: Run Runnables in parallel using RunnableParallel or run multiple inputs through a given chain in parallel using the Runnable Batch API. Parallel execution can significantly reduce the latency as processing can be done in parallel instead of sequentially.\\nGuaranteed Async support: Any chain built with LCEL can be run asynchronously using the Runnable Async API. This can be useful when running chains in a server environment where you want to handle large number of requests concurrently.\\nSimplify streaming: LCEL chains can be streamed, allowing for incremental output as the chain is executed. LangChain can optimize the streaming of the output to minimize the time-to-first-token(time elapsed until the first chunk of output from a chat model or llm comes out).\\n\\nOther benefits include:\\n\\nSeamless LangSmith tracing\\nAs your chains get more and more complex, it becomes increasingly important to understand what exactly is happening at every step.\\nWith LCEL, all steps are automatically logged to LangSmith for maximum observability and debuggability.\\nStandard API: Because all chains are built using the Runnable interface, they can be used in the same way as any other Runnable.\\nDeployable with LangServe: Chains built with LCEL can be deployed using for production use.\\n\\nShould I use LCEL?\\u200b\\nLCEL is an orchestration solution -- it allows LangChain to handle run-time execution of chains in an optimized way.\\nWhile we have seen users run chains with hundreds of steps in production, we generally recommend using LCEL for simpler orchestration tasks. When the application requires complex state management, branching, cycles or multiple agents, we recommend that users take advantage of LangGraph.\\nIn LangGraph, users define graphs that specify the application\\'s flow. This allows users to keep using LCEL within individual nodes when LCEL is needed, while making it easy to define complex orchestration logic that is more readable and maintainable.\\nHere are some guidelines:\\n\\nIf you are making a single LLM call, you don\\'t need LCEL; instead call the underlying chat model directly.\\nIf you have a simple chain (e.g., prompt + llm + parser, simple retrieval set up etc.), LCEL is a reasonable fit, if you\\'re taking advantage of the LCEL benefits.\\nIf you\\'re building a complex chain (e.g., with branching, cycles, multiple agents, etc.) use LangGraph instead. Remember that you can always use LCEL within individual nodes in LangGraph.\\n\\nComposition Primitives\\u200b\\nLCEL chains are built by composing existing Runnables together. The two main composition primitives are RunnableSequence and RunnableParallel.\\nMany other composition primitives (e.g., RunnableAssign) can be thought of as variations of these two primitives.\\nnoteYou can find a list of all composition primitives in the LangChain Core API Reference.\\nRunnableSequence\\u200b\\nRunnableSequence is a composition primitive that allows you \"chain\" multiple runnables sequentially, with the output of one runnable serving as the input to the next.\\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnableSequencechain = RunnableSequence([runnable1, runnable2])API Reference:RunnableSequence\\nInvoking the chain with some input:\\nfinal_output = chain.invoke(some_input)\\ncorresponds to the following:\\noutput1 = runnable1.invoke(some_input)final_output = runnable2.invoke(output1)\\nnoterunnable1 and runnable2 are placeholders for any Runnable that you want to chain together.\\nRunnableParallel\\u200b\\nRunnableParallel is a composition primitive that allows you to run multiple runnables concurrently, with the same input provided to each.\\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnableParallelchain = RunnableParallel({    \"key1\": runnable1,    \"key2\": runnable2,})API Reference:RunnableParallel\\nInvoking the chain with some input:\\nfinal_output = chain.invoke(some_input)\\nWill yield a final_output dictionary with the same keys as the input dictionary, but with the values replaced by the output of the corresponding runnable.\\n{    \"key1\": runnable1.invoke(some_input),    \"key2\": runnable2.invoke(some_input),}\\nRecall, that the runnables are executed in parallel, so while the result is the same as\\ndictionary comprehension shown above, the execution time is much faster.\\nnoteRunnableParallelsupports both synchronous and asynchronous execution (as all Runnables do).\\nFor synchronous execution, RunnableParallel uses a ThreadPoolExecutor to run the runnables concurrently.\\nFor asynchronous execution, RunnableParallel uses asyncio.gather to run the runnables concurrently.\\n\\nComposition Syntax\\u200b\\nThe usage of RunnableSequence and RunnableParallel is so common that we created a shorthand syntax for using them. This helps\\nto make the code more readable and concise.\\nThe | operator\\u200b\\nWe have overloaded the | operator to create a RunnableSequence from two Runnables.\\nchain = runnable1 | runnable2\\nis Equivalent to:\\nchain = RunnableSequence([runnable1, runnable2])\\nThe .pipe method`\\u200b\\nIf you have moral qualms with operator overloading, you can use the .pipe method instead. This is equivalent to the | operator.\\nchain = runnable1.pipe(runnable2)\\nCoercion\\u200b\\nLCEL applies automatic type coercion to make it easier to compose chains.\\nIf you do not understand the type coercion, you can always use the RunnableSequence and RunnableParallel classes directly.\\nThis will make the code more verbose, but it will also make it more explicit.\\nDictionary to RunnableParallel\\u200b\\nInside an LCEL expression, a dictionary is automatically converted to a RunnableParallel.\\nFor example, the following code:\\nmapping = {    \"key1\": runnable1,    \"key2\": runnable2,}chain = mapping | runnable3\\nIt gets automatically converted to the following:\\nchain = RunnableSequence([RunnableParallel(mapping), runnable3])\\ncautionYou have to be careful because the mapping dictionary is not a RunnableParallel object, it is just a dictionary. This means that the following code will raise an AttributeError:mapping.invoke(some_input)\\nFunction to RunnableLambda\\u200b\\nInside an LCEL expression, a function is automatically converted to a RunnableLambda.\\ndef some_func(x):    return xchain = some_func | runnable1\\nIt gets automatically converted to the following:\\nchain = RunnableSequence([RunnableLambda(some_func), runnable1])\\ncautionYou have to be careful because the lambda function is not a RunnableLambda object, it is just a function. This means that the following code will raise an AttributeError:lambda x: x + 1.invoke(some_input)\\nLegacy chains\\u200b\\nLCEL aims to provide consistency around behavior and customization over legacy subclassed chains such as LLMChain and\\nConversationalRetrievalChain. Many of these legacy chains hide important details like prompts, and as a wider variety\\nof viable models emerge, customization has become more and more important.\\nIf you are currently using one of these legacy chains, please see this guide for guidance on how to migrate.\\nFor guides on how to do specific tasks with LCEL, check out the relevant how-to guides.Edit this pageWas this page helpful?PreviousKey-value storesNextMessagesBenefits of LCELShould I use LCEL?Composition PrimitivesRunnableSequenceRunnableParallelComposition SyntaxThe | operatorThe .pipe method`CoercionLegacy chainsCommunityTwitterGitHubOrganizationPythonJS/TSMoreHomepageBlogYouTubeCopyright ¬© 2024 LangChain, Inc.\\n\\n'"
